## Problem Description

You are tasked with building a backend RESTful API using Django Rest Framework that will serve as an online store for products. The API should allow the following operations:

* Create Product: Create a new product with a name, description, price, and quantity.

* List Products: List all products with their names, descriptions, prices, and quantities.

* Retrieve Product: Retrieve a specific product by ID with its name, description, price, and quantity.

* Update Product: Update an existing product's name, description, price, and quantity.

* Delete Product: Delete an existing product.

## Technical Requirements

* Use Django Rest Framework for building the API.

* Use PostgreSQL as the database for storing product information. (But you can use any database. We prefer PostgreSQL)

* Implement the API using RESTful principles.

* Write unit tests to test API's functionality.

Test Instructions

* Fork this Gitlab repository:  https://gitlab.com/{YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME}/django-rest-api-test 

* Create a new branch with the name "test-solution".

* Implement the requirements stated above.

* Write unit tests to test the API's functionality.

* Commit your changes to your branch.

* Create a pull request with the base branch as "main" and the compare branch as "test-solution".

* Send us the link to your pull request.

## Evaluation Criteria

* Correctness: The API should implement all required functionality correctly.

* Code quality: The code should be well-organized, readable, and maintainable.

* Testing: The code should be thoroughly tested with unit tests that cover all API functionality.

* Best practices: The code should follow best practices for Django Rest Framework and PostgreSQL.
